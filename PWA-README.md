# Dictionary App - Progressive Web App (PWA)

## 📱 What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on any device (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) directly from the browser. It works like a native app but is much lighter and easier to distribute.

## ✨ PWA Features

- 📱 **Installable** - Add to home screen on mobile, desktop shortcut on PC
- ⚡ **Fast Loading** - Cached for instant startup
- 🌐 **Works Offline** - Basic functionality without internet
- 📱 **App-like Experience** - Fullscreen, no browser UI
- 🔄 **Auto Updates** - Always latest version when online
- 🎯 **Cross-Platform** - Works on any device with a browser
